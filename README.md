# Allbert Assist

Allbert Assist is a local, Jido-centered personal assistant runtime built as a
Phoenix umbrella app. It is designed around supervised Elixir/OTP processes,
signals, registered Jido actions, Security Central, durable confirmations,
Settings Central, Allbert Home, markdown memory, and inspectable traces.

Phoenix LiveView and Mix tasks are operator surfaces over the runtime. They are
not the architecture center.

## Current Status

v0.10 is implemented through M11 after the reopened M6-M9 sequence.
The original M5 release-readiness gate was reopened for online skill approval
clarity/search fixes and Resource Access Security Posture planning; M9 has now
closed that line with refreshed docs, smoke steps, and final gate results.
M10 has now hardened resource identity and scope matching so canonical
resource authority stays separate from redacted display metadata. M11 has now
added operator-visible remembered grant list/show/revoke behavior,
approve-with-remember options, and grant reuse for existing v0.10 actions. The
remaining planned closeout milestones are M12-M14 for URI-first resource
identity, direct/local skill import consumers, and final v0.11 handoff.
Expected release tag after operator acceptance remains `v0.10`; no v0.10 tag
has been created or pushed yet.

Release details live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What Allbert Can Do Today

- Accept user input through CLI and Phoenix LiveView.
- Route runtime work through `AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1`,
  Jido agents, registered actions, and `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3`.
- Store operator settings, provider profiles, encrypted local secrets, memory,
  confirmations, cache files, and audit artifacts under Allbert Home.
- Persist explicit markdown memory and optional markdown traces.
- Parse, list, read, activate, validate, and scaffold standard `SKILL.md`
  Agent Skills without granting unplanned execution authority.
- Run confirmed local shell commands through Level 1 host policy controls.
- Run confirmed trusted skill script resources through `run_skill_script`.
- Run confirmed `Req` external service requests through
  `external_network_request`.
- Plan and run confirmed npm package installs through package-manager
  profiles; pip remains preview-only in v0.10.
- Search, show, audit, and import online skills through confirmed registered
  actions. Imported skills remain disabled, untrusted, and cached under
  `<ALLBERT_HOME>/cache/skills`.
- Emit shared resource reference metadata for local shell cwd/path operands,
  trusted skill script resources, external requests, online skill sources, and
  package-install targets without changing permission behavior.
- Store and match operation-scoped remembered resource grants in Settings
  Central as generic local/remote resource approval memory. The matcher
  requires the caller to pass the current action permission before use.
- List, inspect, and revoke remembered resource grants through registered
  actions, `mix allbert.resources grants ...`, and the thin `/settings`
  operator surface.
- Approve existing confirmations with remembered exact-resource choices and
  reuse grants for external requests, online skill source reads/imports, and
  package installs when every current resource ref still matches.
- Keep canonical resource identity separate from rendered display metadata for
  external URLs, local paths, source profiles, and confirmation resume
  decisions.
- Treat future resource identity as URI-first. v0.10 M12 is planned to add a
  canonical `resource_uri` substrate while keeping existing refs and grants
  compatible.

v0.10 also implements the first Resource Access Security Posture substrate.
It does not implement arbitrary URL/document summarization, channel-native
Approval Handoff UX, local skill directory import, direct skill URL import, a
browser, crawler, MCP execution path, or `agent://` delegation. M12-M14 finish
the v0.10 closeout before v0.11 consumes the final URI-based posture through
execution-aware intent and channel-native Approval Handoff UX.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and set up the umbrella app:

```sh
mix setup
```

Run the project gate:

```sh
mix precommit
```

Start Phoenix:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Operator surfaces:

```text
http://localhost:4000/agent
http://localhost:4000/settings
```

CLI entrypoints:

```sh
mix allbert.ask "hello"
mix allbert.security status
mix allbert.confirmations list
mix allbert.skills validate apps/allbert_assist/priv/skills/append-memory
```

## Runtime Configuration

- `ALLBERT_HOME`: root for Allbert runtime data; defaults to `~/.allbert`
- `ALLBERT_HOME_DIR`: compatibility alias for `ALLBERT_HOME`
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_ROOT`: specific override for Settings Central
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_MASTER_KEY`: base64-encoded 32-byte secret-store key
- `ALLBERT_MEMORY_ROOT`: root for markdown memory and traces
- `ALLBERT_TRACE_ENABLED=true`: enable trace recording
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: OpenAI-compatible Ollama base URL

The optional `:local` model alias is configured for an OpenAI-compatible
Ollama endpoint. Override the endpoint with:

```sh
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

## Safety Boundaries

Allbert remains local and conservative:

- Runtime-facing side effects go through registered Jido actions, the shared
  action runner, Security Central, Settings Central policy, durable
  confirmation when required, redaction, trace, and audit records.
- v0.08 shell execution is Level 1 host policy control, not OS isolation.
- v0.09 skill scripts run only when trusted, enabled, inventoried,
  digest-verified, confirmed, bounded, audited, and traced.
- v0.10 external services, package installs, and online skill import run only
  through confirmed registered actions and target-specific policy re-checks.
- Imported skills are not trusted, enabled, activated, or executed by import.
- Remote network content consumers must be operation-scoped. A future approval
  for URL summarization must not authorize skill import, package install,
  activation, or script execution.
- Future URI schemes such as `mcp://`, `agent://`, and `agent+https://` may be
  represented only as inert metadata until a later release adds explicit
  action, policy, confirmation, adapter, trace, audit, and tests.
- All user-supplied secrets belong in Settings Central secrets and must be
  redacted in output, traces, audits, logs, and tests.
- All tests and smoke flows should use temporary Allbert homes, never a real
  user's `~/.allbert`.

## Verification Pointers

README is intentionally not the testing plan. Use:

- `docs/operator/onboarding.md` for first-run operator guidance.
- `docs/plans/v0.10-request-flow.md` for the v0.10 smoke matrix.
- `docs/plans/v0.10-plan.md` for milestone-specific verification.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for release status, verification summary, and tag readiness.
