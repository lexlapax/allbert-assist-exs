# Allbert Assist

Allbert Assist is a local, Jido-centered personal assistant runtime built as a
Phoenix umbrella app. It is designed around supervised Elixir/OTP processes,
signals, registered Jido actions, Security Central, durable confirmations,
Settings Central, Allbert Home, markdown memory, and inspectable traces.

Phoenix LiveView and Mix tasks are operator surfaces over the runtime. They are
not the architecture center.

## Current Status

v0.10 is ready for operator/user testing after the M5 release-readiness gate
and the post-M5 Resource Access Security Posture documentation clarification.
Expected release tag after operator acceptance: `v0.10`. No v0.10 tag has
been created or pushed yet.

Release details live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What Allbert Can Do Today

- Accept user input through CLI and Phoenix LiveView.
- Route runtime work through `AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1`,
  Jido agents, registered actions, and `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3`.
- Store operator settings, provider profiles, encrypted local secrets, memory,
  confirmations, cache files, and audit artifacts under Allbert Home.
- Persist explicit markdown memory and optional markdown traces.
- Parse, list, read, activate, validate, and scaffold standard `SKILL.md`
  Agent Skills without granting unplanned execution authority.
- Run confirmed local shell commands through Level 1 host policy controls.
- Run confirmed trusted skill script resources through `run_skill_script`.
- Run confirmed `Req` external service requests through
  `external_network_request`.
- Plan and run confirmed npm package installs through package-manager
  profiles; pip remains preview-only in v0.10.
- Search, show, audit, and import online skills through confirmed registered
  actions. Imported skills remain disabled, untrusted, and cached under
  `<ALLBERT_HOME>/cache/skills`.

v0.10 also documents the first Resource Access Security Posture substrate.
Future URL summaries, document inspection, direct skill URL imports, local
skill directory imports, and other local/remote resource consumers should
consume that posture through operation-scoped approval in v0.11; v0.10 does
not implement arbitrary URL/document summarization, remembered resource grants,
local skill directory import, direct skill URL import, a browser, or a crawler.

## Local Development

Install dependencies and set up the umbrella app:

```sh
mix setup
```

Run the project gate:

```sh
mix precommit
```

Start Phoenix:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Operator surfaces:

```text
http://localhost:4000/agent
http://localhost:4000/settings
```

CLI entrypoints:

```sh
mix allbert.ask "hello"
mix allbert.security status
mix allbert.confirmations list
mix allbert.skills validate apps/allbert_assist/priv/skills/append-memory
```

## Runtime Configuration

- `ALLBERT_HOME`: root for Allbert runtime data; defaults to `~/.allbert`
- `ALLBERT_HOME_DIR`: compatibility alias for `ALLBERT_HOME`
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_ROOT`: specific override for Settings Central
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_MASTER_KEY`: base64-encoded 32-byte secret-store key
- `ALLBERT_MEMORY_ROOT`: root for markdown memory and traces
- `ALLBERT_TRACE_ENABLED=true`: enable trace recording
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: OpenAI-compatible Ollama base URL

The optional `:local` model alias is configured for an OpenAI-compatible
Ollama endpoint. Override the endpoint with:

```sh
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

## Safety Boundaries

Allbert remains local and conservative:

- Runtime-facing side effects go through registered Jido actions, the shared
  action runner, Security Central, Settings Central policy, durable
  confirmation when required, redaction, trace, and audit records.
- v0.08 shell execution is Level 1 host policy control, not OS isolation.
- v0.09 skill scripts run only when trusted, enabled, inventoried,
  digest-verified, confirmed, bounded, audited, and traced.
- v0.10 external services, package installs, and online skill import run only
  through confirmed registered actions and target-specific policy re-checks.
- Imported skills are not trusted, enabled, activated, or executed by import.
- Remote network content consumers must be operation-scoped. A future approval
  for URL summarization must not authorize skill import, package install,
  activation, or script execution.
- All user-supplied secrets belong in Settings Central secrets and must be
  redacted in output, traces, audits, logs, and tests.
- All tests and smoke flows should use temporary Allbert homes, never a real
  user's `~/.allbert`.

## Verification Pointers

README is intentionally not the testing plan. Use:

- `docs/operator/onboarding.md` for first-run operator guidance.
- `docs/plans/v0.10-request-flow.md` for the v0.10 smoke matrix.
- `docs/plans/v0.10-plan.md` for milestone-specific verification.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for release status, verification summary, and tag readiness.
