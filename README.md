# Allbert Assist

Allbert Assist is a local, Jido-centered personal assistant runtime built as a
Phoenix umbrella app. It is designed around supervised Elixir/OTP processes,
signals, registered Jido actions, Security Central, durable confirmations,
Settings Central, Allbert Home, markdown memory, and inspectable traces.

Phoenix LiveView and Mix tasks are operator surfaces over the runtime. They are
not the architecture center.

## Current Status

v0.26 is implemented and ready for operator manual validation. It upgrades
`/agent` into the Allbert workspace: a Surface-tree LiveView shell with
per-thread canvas tiles, per-thread ephemeral surfaces, signed runtime
Fragments, a 42-component catalog, multi-tab sync, theme/accessibility/mobile
polish, a service-worker offline shell, browser-side Yjs + IndexedDB
text/markdown editing, server-side revision snapshots, conflict banners, and
the `revert_tile_revision` action. Version metadata is now `0.26.0`.

v0.25 remains the native-financial-specialist release. It adds StockSage
native agents, action-backed evidence providers, multi-round debate with
objective-step observability, explicit native/Python parity runs, and the core
`mix allbert.delegate <agent_id>` cross-app delegate-agent proof.

Operator loop:

```sh
mix allbert.ask "analyze AAPL and compare to MSFT" --user local
mix allbert.objectives list --user local
mix allbert.objectives show <objective_id> --user local
mix allbert.confirmations approve <confirmation_id> --reason "..."
mix allbert.objectives continue <objective_id> --user local
mix stocksage.analyze AAPL 2026-05-15 --user local --engine native --evidence-mode fixture
mix stocksage.analyze AAPL 2026-05-15 --user local --engine both --evidence-mode fixture --force-stub
mix allbert.delegate stocksage.market_context '{"ticker":"AAPL","analysis_date":"2026-05-15","evidence_mode":"fixture","fixture":true}' --user local
mix allbert.workspace inspect
mix allbert.workspace canvas list
```

v0.23 remains the internal convergence milestone: `Confirmations.Store` and
`Jobs.Scheduler` keep their public facades and durable stores, but run through
Jido-backed coordinator agents under `AllbertAssist.JidoBacked.Supervisor`.
Operator-facing confirmation, job, channel, memory, and StockSage flows remain
identical to v0.22 by default.

v0.22 was released and tagged as `v0.22` on 2026-05-16 after audit closeout
and post-implementation gap fixes. It adds the StockSage Python bridge: a
supervised JSON-over-stdio Port wraps a `bridge.py` subprocess, a new
`StockSage.Actions.RunAnalysis` Jido action takes a ticker and analysis date
through a durable confirmation, the bridge runs after operator approval, and
the result persists into the `stocksage_analyses` / `stocksage_analysis_details`
tables already established in v0.20. The bridge requires confirmation by
default through the new `:stocksage_analyze` permission class, whose safety
floor (`needs_confirmation`) cannot be lowered through settings.

Operator loop (M3/M4):

```sh
mix stocksage.analyze AAPL 2026-05-01 --user local
# → "Confirmation id: conf_..." printed; no bridge call yet
mix allbert.confirmations approve <id> --reason "..."
# → bridge runs, analysis row persisted
mix allbert.ask "list my stocksage analyses"
```

v0.21 remains the memory review and retrieval release: review-aware markdown
memory, `mix allbert.memory`, confirmation-gated delete/prune/promotion flows,
derived memory index and summary artifacts, metadata-only memory candidates in
the intent engine, and memory review trace rendering.

v0.20 remains the StockSage plugin app and domain release. It makes StockSage
the first real shipped plugin workspace app, with a `./plugins/stocksage`
package, shared SQLite `stocksage_*` tables, read-only legacy import, safe
local StockSage actions, StockSage skills, and bounded operator CLIs.

v0.19 remains the cross-surface intent enrichment release: registry-aware
intent candidates, active-app affinity, inert registered-surface navigation,
optional model-assisted classification disabled by default, intent candidate
trace rendering, and read-only `explain_intent` / `list_intent_candidates`
inspection actions.

v0.18 remains the full local app/surface contract:
`AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider`, the validated `AllbertAssist.Surface` DSL,
`CoreApp` declaring `/agent` as the built-in chat surface, `active_app:
:allbert` runtime fallback, app/plugin settings schema merging, and
`mix allbert.validate_app`.

v0.17 remains the local plugin contract: plugin
discovery/registry/bootstrap/supervision, shipped source-tree Telegram and
email channel plugins, plugin-contributed skill roots/apps/actions, read-only
plugin inspection actions, and `mix allbert.plugins`.

v0.16 remains the supervised Telegram and email channel substrate: durable
channel events, explicit external identity mapping, channel-native runtime
responses, confirmation callbacks/commands, and `mix allbert.channels`.

v0.15 was released and tagged as `v0.15` on 2026-05-14. It remains the minimal
`AllbertAssist.App` contract, supervised app registry, built-in `CoreApp`,
transitional `StockSageStub`, app capability tagging, app-contributed skill
paths, and `mix allbert.apps`.

v0.14 was released and tagged as `v0.14` on 2026-05-14. It remains the
volatile supervised session scratchpad and active-app context substrate.

v0.13 was released and tagged as `v0.13` on 2026-05-14. It remains the local
SQLite-backed scheduled-jobs substrate for runtime prompt jobs, registered
action jobs, due polling, durable run records, job lifecycle signals, and thin
`/jobs` LiveView inspection.

v0.12 was released and tagged as `v0.12` on 2026-05-13. It remains the local
workspace identity and conversation-history substrate for scheduled job
ownership context.

v0.11 was released and tagged as `v0.11` on 2026-05-13. It remains the
execution-aware intent, operation-scoped Resource Access, and Approval Handoff
substrate that v0.12 now records in thread history.

v0.10 was released and tagged as `v0.10` on 2026-05-04. It remains the
substrate for confirmed shell, skill script, external service, package, online
skill, direct skill URL, and local skill directory actions that v0.11 now wraps
with intent decisions and handoff metadata.

Release details live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What Allbert Can Do Today

- Accept user input through CLI and Phoenix LiveView.
- Route runtime work through `AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1`,
  Jido agents, registered actions, and `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3`.
- Run confirmation-store and scheduled-job coordination through
  `AllbertAssist.JidoBacked` agents while keeping durable YAML/SQLite stores
  authoritative.
- Frame multi-step or cross-turn work as durable objectives with
  `objectives`, `objective_steps`, and `objective_events` rows.
- Inspect and steer objectives through `mix allbert.objectives list`,
  `mix allbert.objectives show`, `mix allbert.objectives continue`, and
  `mix allbert.objectives cancel --reason ...`.
- Route objective execution through `Actions.Runner.run/3`, Security Central,
  and durable confirmations; `objective_id` and `step_id` are context, not
  authority.
- Render objective context in traces, CLI confirmations, Telegram and email
  confirmation handoffs, `/agent` objective badges, and `/objectives/:id`.
- Persist local SQLite conversation threads and ordered user/assistant
  messages with string `user_id` and `thread_id`.
- Continue the user's recent general thread by default, create a fresh thread
  with `mix allbert.ask --new-thread`, and inspect history with
  `mix allbert.threads`.
- Preserve Alice/Bob style local user isolation for thread continuation and
  thread inspection without adding hosted accounts or roles.
- Pass bounded recent thread context to the intent agent as structured
  `thread_context`.
- Create, list, pause, resume, manually run, and inspect local scheduled jobs
  through `mix allbert.jobs`.
- Run due active jobs through a supervised local scheduler that reuses the
  runtime and registered action runner boundaries.
- Instantiate low-risk scheduled job templates explicitly with
  `mix allbert.jobs create template ...`; templates are normal job rows after
  creation.
- Inspect scheduled jobs and recent runs in the thin `/jobs` LiveView surface.
- Review, correct, prune, delete, search, summarize, and promote markdown
  memory entries through `mix allbert.memory`.
- Compile rebuildable memory index/summary artifacts and expose
  metadata-only memory candidates in intent traces.
- Set, clear, list, and inspect volatile session scratchpad entries through
  `mix allbert.sessions`.
- Pass `--session` to `mix allbert.ask` so runtime turns can read
  scratchpad-backed `active_app` context.
- Carry `active_app` through runtime signals, intent-agent request context,
  decisions, traces, responses, assistant message metadata, and scheduled
  runtime prompt job logs without treating it as authorization.
- Register local workspace apps through `AllbertAssist.App` and a supervised
  volatile `AllbertAssist.App.Registry`.
- Inspect registered apps through `mix allbert.apps list/show/validate` and
  the read-only registered `list_apps`/`show_app` actions.
- Keep `allbert` and `stocksage` app ids valid through built-in `CoreApp` and
  the real plugin-contributed `StockSage.App`.
- Discover local plugins from `./plugins` and `<ALLBERT_HOME>/plugins` through
  `AllbertAssist.Plugin.Registry` without loading arbitrary code.
- Inspect normalized plugin metadata through `mix allbert.plugins
  list/show/diagnostics` and read-only registered `list_plugins`/`show_plugin`
  actions.
- Ship Telegram and email as source-tree channel plugins under
  `./plugins/allbert.telegram` and `./plugins/allbert.email` while preserving
  the v0.16 channel boundary.
- Allow trusted compiled source-tree plugins to contribute apps, channels,
  actions, skill roots, settings schema metadata, and supervised child specs
  without granting permissions or bypassing Security Central.
- Validate the full local app/surface contract through
  `mix allbert.validate_app MODULE`.
- Let apps declare provider surfaces through
  `AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider` and validated
  `AllbertAssist.Surface` nodes.
- Treat `/agent` as the built-in `CoreApp` workspace surface: a validated
  Surface tree rendered through the workspace catalog.
- Persist per-thread canvas tiles and per-thread ephemeral surfaces under
  Allbert Home with SQLite metadata and YAML bodies.
- Emit and validate signed workspace Fragments, render them as tiles or
  ephemeral surfaces, and inspect workspace state through
  `mix allbert.workspace`.
- Edit text and markdown tiles offline through the browser Yjs/IndexedDB
  editor, then reconcile bounded snapshots back to the server with conflict
  banners and revert support.
- Default runtime turns with no known app context to `active_app: allbert` and
  record that context in signals, traces, responses, and conversation metadata.
- Collect bounded intent candidates from registered actions, trusted skills,
  and registered app surfaces, then record selected/rejected candidate
  reasoning in traces.
- Return inert navigation suggestions for registered surfaces such as
  `/agent` without generating routes or executing actions.
- Keep optional model-assisted intent classification disabled by default; when
  enabled, proposals must select from already-collected candidates.
- Inspect intent decisions and candidate sets through read-only internal
  `explain_intent` and `list_intent_candidates` actions.
- Import representative legacy StockSage SQLite data into local
  `stocksage_*` tables with `mix stocksage.import_sqlite`.
- List/show local StockSage analyses and create/list local StockSage queue
  rows with `mix stocksage.analyses` and `mix stocksage.queue`.
- Route active StockSage session or one-turn CLI app context toward the safe
  local StockSage actions contributed by `StockSage.Plugin`; native
  financial specialist agents are advisory, action-backed, and bounded by
  Security Central rather than autonomous trading.
- Merge app/plugin-contributed settings schema entries into Settings Central
  at read and validation time.
- Tag registered action capabilities with optional `app_id` when an app claims
  the action, without granting permissions from that tag.
- Include app-contributed skill paths in skill discovery after project roots
  and before user roots.
- Configure Telegram and email channel credentials through Settings Secrets and
  map external Telegram user ids or sender email addresses to local string
  `user_id` values through Settings Central.
- Receive Telegram Bot API long-poll updates and email IMAP messages through
  supervised adapters that submit mapped text to
  `AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1`.
- Render runtime responses back through Telegram messages or plain-text email
  replies, while retaining conversation history in SQLite `Thread`/`Message`
  rows and transport metadata in `channel_events`.
- Resolve durable confirmations from Telegram inline buttons or typed email
  commands through the existing registered confirmation actions.
- Exercise both channel flows locally without provider access through
  `mix allbert.channels telegram simulate ...` and
  `mix allbert.channels email simulate ...`.
- Store operator settings, provider profiles, encrypted local secrets, memory,
  confirmations, cache files, and audit artifacts under Allbert Home.
- Persist explicit markdown memory and optional markdown traces.
- Parse, list, read, activate, validate, and scaffold standard `SKILL.md`
  Agent Skills without granting unplanned execution authority.
- Run confirmed local shell commands through Level 1 host policy controls.
- Run confirmed trusted skill script resources through `run_skill_script`.
- Run confirmed `Req` external service requests through
  `external_network_request`.
- Plan and run confirmed npm package installs through package-manager
  profiles; pip remains preview-only in v0.10.
- Search, show, audit, and import online skills through confirmed registered
  actions. Imported skills remain disabled, untrusted, and cached under
  `<ALLBERT_HOME>/cache/skills`.
- Import direct HTTPS skill URLs and local skill directories through confirmed
  registered actions and `mix allbert.skills import-url/import-local`.
  Imported candidates remain disabled, untrusted, inactive, and non-executable.
- Attach an inert `AllbertAssist.Intent.Decision` to runtime turns, including
  selected action, permission, confirmation, resource posture, reserved
  `user_id`/`thread_id` context, and trace metadata.
- Render Approval Handoff data in CLI and LiveView for pending confirmations
  without giving channels direct approval or execution authority.
- Route URL summary and remote document inspection prompts to pending
  `external_network_request` confirmations with `summarize_url` or
  `inspect_document` operation classes. Approved fetches report the missing
  summarizer or extractor clearly rather than inventing a downstream consumer.
- Represent generic local file inspection as inert `file://...` posture with an
  explicit no-shell-fallback unavailable state.
- Keep MCP/agent resource calls, broad crawling/research, and future
  channel-native approval handoff as explicit unsupported workflows until later
  adapter plans add security and approval semantics.
- Emit shared resource reference metadata for local shell cwd/path operands,
  trusted skill script resources, external requests, online skill sources, and
  package-install targets without changing permission behavior.
- Store and match operation-scoped remembered resource grants in Settings
  Central as generic local/remote resource approval memory. The matcher
  requires the caller to pass the current action permission before use.
- List, inspect, and revoke remembered resource grants through registered
  actions, `mix allbert.resources grants ...`, and the thin `/settings`
  operator surface.
- Approve existing confirmations with remembered exact-resource choices and
  reuse grants for external requests, online skill source reads/imports, and
  package installs when every current resource ref still matches.
- Keep canonical resource identity separate from rendered display metadata for
  external URLs, local paths, source profiles, and confirmation resume
  decisions.
- Treat resource identity as URI-first. v0.10 M12 adds canonical
  `resource_uri` refs/grants; pre-M12 remembered grant records without
  `resource_uri` should be re-created through the current approval/resource
  grant UX.

v0.18 does not add hosted auth, roles, distributed scheduling, remote workers,
archive/delete workflow, durable app-registry persistence, app-scoped
permissions, app-owned jobs, app-scoped intent routing, SMS,
Discord, Slack, webhooks, IMAP IDLE, SMTP provider APIs, proactive broadcast,
dynamic route loading, workspace UI replacement, canvas state,
semantic retrieval, vector search, browser/crawler behavior, MCP execution,
`agent://` delegation, generic local file reading, remote plugin installs,
package-manager execution during plugin discovery, hot reload, arbitrary code
loading from `<ALLBERT_HOME>/plugins`, or automatic compilation of arbitrary
`./plugins/*/lib` folders. Every effect still flows through registered actions,
Security Central, Settings Central policy, durable confirmations, redaction,
traces, and audits.

## Runtime Configuration

- `ALLBERT_HOME`: root for Allbert runtime data; defaults to `~/.allbert`
- `ALLBERT_HOME_DIR`: compatibility alias for `ALLBERT_HOME`
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_ROOT`: specific override for Settings Central
- `ALLBERT_SETTINGS_MASTER_KEY`: base64-encoded 32-byte secret-store key
- `ALLBERT_MEMORY_ROOT`: root for markdown memory and traces
- `ALLBERT_TRACE_ENABLED=true`: enable trace recording
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: OpenAI-compatible Ollama base URL

The optional `:local` model alias is configured for an OpenAI-compatible
Ollama endpoint. Override the endpoint with:

```sh
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

## Safety Boundaries

Allbert remains local and conservative:

- Runtime-facing side effects go through registered Jido actions, the shared
  action runner, Security Central, Settings Central policy, durable
  confirmation when required, redaction, trace, and audit records.
- v0.08 shell execution is Level 1 host policy control, not OS isolation.
- v0.09 skill scripts run only when trusted, enabled, inventoried,
  digest-verified, confirmed, bounded, audited, and traced.
- v0.10 external services, package installs, and online skill import run only
  through confirmed registered actions and target-specific policy re-checks.
- v0.11 intent decisions and Approval Handoff are descriptive metadata, not
  authorization. Approval still resumes only the stored target action through
  `approve_confirmation`.
- v0.12 conversation history is local SQLite context, not an auth boundary.
  `user_id` scopes local thread UX but does not replace Security Central or
  hosted authorization.
- v0.13 scheduled jobs are local automation records, not a new authority
  layer. Risky job work stops at the same durable confirmation workflow and
  cannot bypass operation-scoped resource posture.
- v0.14 session scratchpad is volatile context, not durable memory,
  authorization, app registration, or app routing. Raw working-memory values
  must not appear in CLI output, traces, signals, logs, responses, or persisted
  action logs.
- v0.15 app registration is contract data, not authority. `app_id` tags,
  registered surfaces, and app skill paths do not grant permissions, create
  routes, load code dynamically, or bypass Security Central.
- Imported skills are not trusted, enabled, activated, or executed by import.
- Remote network content consumers are operation-scoped. A `summarize_url` or
  `inspect_document` approval must not authorize skill import, package install,
  activation, or script execution.
- Future URI schemes such as `mcp://`, `agent://`, and `agent+https://` may be
  represented only as inert metadata until a later release adds explicit
  action, policy, confirmation, adapter, trace, audit, and tests.
- All user-supplied secrets belong in Settings Central secrets and must be
  redacted in output, traces, audits, logs, and tests.
- All tests and smoke flows should use temporary Allbert homes, never a real
  user's `~/.allbert`.
