# ADR 0015: Allbert App Contract And Surface DSL

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Allbert is becoming a personal AI workspace rather than a single chat surface.
StockSage is the first planned domain app inside that workspace. It needs to
register actions, skills, app navigation, signals, settings, and eventually
canvas components without reaching through private Allbert internals.

ADR 0017 adds a broader plugin contract. That decision does not replace the
app contract. A plugin is the package/discovery boundary; an app is one
contribution type inside that boundary.

The existing core already has important boundaries: registered Jido actions,
the shared action runner, Security Central, Settings Central, Agent Skills
discovery, Phoenix PubSub, and the Jido signal bus. What it lacks is a public
contract for another umbrella app to participate as a first-class Allbert
workspace app.

v0.24 also plans an agentic workspace surface and declarative UI substrate.
That canvas should consume a stable Allbert-native app and surface contract
rather than inventing app discovery, component catalogs, or node shapes inside
the LiveView implementation.

External protocols such as AG-UI and A2UI are useful research references, but
Allbert's local web surface should remain Phoenix LiveView over supervised
Elixir data structures first. Protocol compatibility can be added later as an
adapter after the local contract is proven.

## Decision

Allbert will define an app contract centered on `AllbertAssist.App` and
managed by `AllbertAssist.App.Registry`.

The minimal contract for v0.15, formerly M-AppContract-Lite, includes:

- app identity: `app_id`, display name, and version
- startup validation and child supervision
- registered Jido actions tagged with `app_id`
- app skill paths added to the global skill registry
- navigation surface descriptors for the future Allbert shell

The v0.15 registry is volatile and supervised as one unit: registry ETS
state, app child supervision, and bootstrap registration restart together.
String app ids are normalized through the registry without creating atoms from
operator, model, channel, or job input. v0.15 navigation surface descriptors
are display data only; they do not mount routes, load LiveViews, or define
canvas nodes.

The v0.18 contract, formerly M-AppContract-Full, expands the app/surface
contract into these layers, with memory namespace registration explicitly
deferred to v0.27:

- Identity and OTP lifecycle: validation, child specs, and workspace config
  injection.
- Agents, actions, and signals: registered agents/actions, declared emitted
  and subscribed signal topics, and scoped routing metadata.
- Skills: app-owned `SKILL.md` paths discovered through the existing Agent
  Skills registry.
- UI surface: navigation surfaces, configured routes, surface providers, and
  later canvas component catalogs.
- Data and settings: settings schema declarations; memory namespaces the app
  may write through existing Allbert boundaries are added in v0.27.

`AllbertAssist.App.Registry` is the runtime app discovery point. In v0.15,
registered apps provide identity, child supervision, action tags, skill paths,
navigation descriptors, and app lookup for active-app validation. In v0.18,
the same public contract expands to declared signals, settings schemas, and
interactive surface providers. Memory namespace registration is the final
deferred layer, added in v0.27. App registration does not grant permission by
itself; actions still run through the action runner, Security Central,
confirmations, traces, and audits.

Allbert will define `AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider` for apps with
interactive surfaces. Surface events must return Jido signals or route through
registered actions. LiveView renders and collects operator input; it does not
own app domain logic, approval storage, security policy, or resource grants.

Allbert will define `AllbertAssist.Surface` as the native declarative surface
DSL for v0.24 canvas artifacts and task-scoped ephemeral UI. Surface nodes are
Elixir data validated against a known component catalog. Model output cannot
invent arbitrary HTML, JavaScript, LiveView components, actions, permissions,
resource identities, scripts, URLs, or secret-bearing fields.

AG-UI and A2UI remain optional future adapters. The first local substrate uses
LiveView, PubSub, Jido signals, registered actions, and
`AllbertAssist.Surface` directly. Any external protocol encoder must preserve
the same validation, provenance, fallback text, redaction, and action-binding
rules.

`AllbertAssist.App.CoreApp` is the first `SurfaceProvider` implementation,
established in v0.18. It declares the `/agent` conversation route as the
built-in chat surface — the default surface every channel and runtime turn
lands on when no other `active_app` is active. Channel-delivered requests
default to `active_app: :allbert` in v0.18 so every turn has a declared home
app. v0.24 upgrades `CoreApp`'s surface from `/agent` into the full workspace
shell; it is `CoreApp`'s surface implementation, not a separate shell.

StockSage is the second proving app for this contract. v0.20, formerly M-D2a,
implements `StockSage.App` with the v0.18 app/surface contract from day one —
there is no lite→full migration. v0.25 builds all StockSage LiveViews on
`AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider` from day one; there is no stepping-stone
static route mounting that later migrates to the surface contract. Memory
namespace registration is the one deferred layer, added in v0.27 where
StockSage polish first consumes it.

The `AllbertAssist.Surface.Encoder.to_a2ui/1` stub is introduced in v0.18 as
the designated AG-UI adaptation interface. Its type signature documents the
intended translation from `AllbertAssist.Surface.Node` to AG-UI
`STATE_SNAPSHOT`-style events. Concrete AG-UI protocol emission is deferred to
post-v0.29 adapter work.

## Consequences

- Every runtime turn has a declared home app from v0.18: `active_app: :allbert`
  by default, overridden when a specific app context is active.
- The built-in chat surface (`/agent`, upgraded to the workspace shell in v0.24)
  is formally declared through `CoreApp`'s `SurfaceProvider`, not an orphan
  LiveView route.
- StockSage can be added as a plugin-contributed umbrella app without private
  routing, security, or skill-registration shortcuts.
- Intent routing can use `active_app` from session context to prioritize
  app-scoped actions while keeping cross-app routing explicit.
- v0.24 has a concrete app registry and surface DSL to consume for workspace
  shell navigation and canvas component validation. v0.24 is `CoreApp`'s
  surface upgrade, not a separate shell.
- Future Allbert apps get a stable contract before generator work begins.
- The app contract does not add new execution authority. Permission decisions
  remain at the action boundary.

## Deferred

- `mix allbert.gen.plugin` and `mix allbert.gen.app` scaffolding, until
  StockSage proves the plugin/app contract, StockSage SurfaceProvider
  LiveViews, memory namespace completion, and canvas path through v0.28.
- AG-UI streaming endpoints, A2UI renderer compatibility, MCP Apps, and
  third-party remote UI execution.
- Dynamic runtime mounting of arbitrary routes or LiveView components from
  untrusted app folders.
- Hosted marketplace publishing of app skill packs.
