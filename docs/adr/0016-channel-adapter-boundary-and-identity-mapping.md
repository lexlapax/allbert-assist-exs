# ADR 0016: Channel Adapter Boundary And Identity Mapping

Status: Accepted

Date: 2026-05-14

## Context

Allbert began with CLI and LiveView as local operator surfaces. v0.16 adds the
first two remote channels, Telegram and email, while preserving the signal-first
Jido runtime, Security Central, durable confirmations, Resource Access Security
Posture, local workspace identity, and app registration decisions made in earlier
ADRs.

External channels bring external identities, provider APIs, callbacks, delivery
failures, and duplicate inbound events. Without a clear boundary, a channel
adapter could accidentally become a second runtime, a second security policy,
or an implicit account system.

Several design questions arose in planning v0.16:

**Why long polling instead of webhooks (Telegram)?** Long polling requires no
public inbound HTTP endpoint, no TLS certificate management, and no
port-forwarding. It works locally with zero infrastructure. Webhooks are a
future option but require a public URL and are deferred.

**Why IMAP polling instead of IMAP IDLE or email API (email)?** IMAP PUSH/IDLE
requires a persistent connection and connection re-issue handling that adds
complexity for a first adapter. Email provider APIs (Mailgun/SendGrid inbound,
Gmail API) require OAuth or webhook infrastructure. Plain IMAP polling with
bounded poll intervals works with any IMAP server and zero public URL
requirements. IMAP IDLE and provider API are left as documented placeholders
for a future release.

**Why a separate `channel_events` table instead of annotating conversation
history?** `Thread`/`Message` rows (v0.12) own ordered conversation content
and are the source of truth for what was said. `channel_events` own the
provider-level transport metadata: which provider update id or Message-ID
arrived, what its delivery status was, which external identity sent it, whether
it was a duplicate, and what channel-level errors occurred. Mixing these concerns
into `Thread`/`Message` would couple the conversation model to provider-specific
fields and make dedup logic depend on conversation semantics.

**Why derive Telegram polling offset from `channel_events` instead of a
separate state row?** The maximum `external_event_id` among processed inbound
and callback events is already the correct resume offset. A separate state row
would need to be kept in sync with `channel_events` insertions and would be an
additional failure surface. Deriving it from `channel_events` at startup is
idempotent and requires no extra write path.

**Why use RFC Message-ID as the email dedup key instead of an offset?** Email
does not have a monotonic server-assigned update id like Telegram. Message-ID is
globally unique per RFC 2822 and is stable across IMAP session restarts. The
IMAP `\Seen` flag provides a second dedup guard: if the adapter crashes before
marking `\Seen`, it will re-fetch the message, but the `channel_events` unique
index prevents double-processing.

**Why a SHA-256 hash for `session_id`?** External user identifiers from Telegram
(integer user ids) and email (from-addresses) are provider-specific strings that
could collide with operator-created session ids or become atoms if stored
carelessly. A bounded, non-reversible hash is safe to store in ETS, in
`channel_events`, and in runtime request metadata without creating atoms or
leaking external identifiers. Telegram session ids include the chat id in the
hash input so a single Telegram user in two different group chats gets different
sessions; email session ids use only the sender address since email has no chat
concept.

**Why SMTP via gen_smtp instead of a provider API?** gen_smtp is OTP-native,
mature, and works with any SMTP server without external account setup. Provider
APIs (Mailgun, SendGrid) add OAuth or API key management that is a separate
secret surface. gen_smtp is the right first delivery adapter; provider API is a
documented placeholder for a future release.

## Decision

Channel adapters are delivery adapters around
`AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1` and registered Jido actions. They
normalize inbound provider messages, resolve configured local identity, submit
runtime requests, render responses, and record durable channel event metadata.

Channels do not own:

- intent selection
- action execution
- Security Central policy
- Resource Access grants
- confirmation storage or private mutation
- conversation history
- markdown memory
- app registry semantics

The canonical local identity remains string `user_id` from ADR 0014. External
provider identities map to local `user_id` values only through explicit
Settings Central configuration. No external identity may implicitly claim
`"local"` or any other existing local user.

For v0.16, Telegram and email are the first two proving adapters.

Telegram: user IDs map to local users through `channels.telegram.identity_map`.
The bot token is stored through Settings Secrets and referenced by
`channels.telegram.bot_token_ref`. Inbound updates arrive via long polling
(`getUpdates`). Approval Handoff is rendered as inline keyboard buttons when
callback data fits the compact format, or as typed commands when it does not.

Email: sender addresses (from-address) map to local users through
`channels.email.identity_map`. IMAP credentials are stored through Settings
Secrets. Inbound messages are fetched by polling UNSEEN messages. Approval
Handoff is rendered as plain-text typed commands (`ALLBERT:APPROVE:<id>`,
`ALLBERT:DENY:<id>`, `ALLBERT:SHOW:<id>`) that the user sends back in a reply.
Outbound replies use SMTP via gen_smtp. IMAP IDLE and SMTP provider APIs are
explicitly deferred with documented placeholders.

Channel adapters may use a bounded provider client for receive/send operations
against the configured provider API. This provider transport is not a general
remote access primitive and does not authorize arbitrary HTTP requests, media
downloads, document extraction, package installs, skill imports, or browser
automation.

Inbound and callback provider events are recorded in SQLite `channel_events`
for dedupe, status, and traceability. Conversation text remains in v0.12
SQLite `Thread`/`Message` history after runtime acceptance. Channel events keep
redacted/truncated summaries rather than full raw provider payload dumps.

Email attachments are never downloaded, extracted, parsed, rendered, forwarded
to the runtime, or used as memory.

Provider callback actions, such as Telegram approve/deny buttons and email
approve/deny typed commands, resolve existing durable confirmations through
registered confirmation actions and `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner`. Callback
data and typed command patterns must not embed resource targets, shell commands,
URLs, prompt text, credentials, or remembered grant powers.

The two adapters are supervised independently under `:one_for_one` in
`AllbertAssist.Channels.Supervisor`. A crash or misconfiguration in one adapter
does not restart or disable the other.

## Consequences

- v0.16 can add Telegram and email without creating hosted accounts or
  role-based auth.
- Tests can prove channel behavior using simulated updates and a test provider
  client (`Req.Test` for Telegram; simulated IMAP/SMTP message injection for
  email) without depending on live network access, real bot tokens, or real
  mail servers.
- The channel substrate (`AllbertAssist.Channels`), event dedupe model
  (`channel_events`), identity mapping posture
  (`AllbertAssist.Channels.Identity`), session_id derivation, and response
  rendering pattern are provider-neutral. Adding a new provider requires a new
  Adapter/Client(s)/Renderer/Parser triple; the rest of the substrate is
  reused.
- Telegram polling offset is resilient: adapter restarts derive the correct
  offset from `channel_events` without a separate state table, and the partial
  unique index provides a second dedup guard.
- Email dedup is resilient: the IMAP `\Seen` flag prevents re-fetch on normal
  restarts; the `channel_events` unique index on Message-ID prevents
  double-runtime submission even if `\Seen` is not set before a crash.
- `session_id` values for Telegram sessions are stable, bounded, and safe to
  store as strings in ETS, SQLite, and runtime metadata. Telegram includes
  chat id in the hash so group and private chats get separate sessions. Email
  session ids use only the sender address since email has no chat concept.
- v0.23 security evals have concrete cross-channel surfaces to test:
  identity spoofing, callback replay, command injection in email reply bodies,
  resource-scope leakage, provider payload injection, cross-user thread leakage,
  secret redaction in provider error responses, and attachment bypass attempts.
- IMAP IDLE, SMTP provider API, webhooks, media downloads, and arbitrary
  provider method exposure require a new ADR or a future v0.16+ plan revision;
  this ADR intentionally excludes them with documented placeholders.

## Deferred

- Hosted accounts, OAuth, roles, and remote multi-user administration.
- Telegram webhooks and public inbound HTTP routing.
- IMAP IDLE for push-based email delivery (placeholder in v0.16 adapter code).
- SMTP provider API (Mailgun, SendGrid) for transactional sending (placeholder
  in v0.16 adapter code).
- Email attachment download, extraction, and content forwarding.
- HTML email parsing or rich email rendering.
- Email, SMS, Discord, Slack, native app, browser, and MCP channels beyond the
  v0.16 Telegram and email proving adapters.
- Media/document download and deep remote document extraction.
- Proactive broadcast and scheduled outbound messaging.
- UI protocol interop and workspace-native channel surfaces.
