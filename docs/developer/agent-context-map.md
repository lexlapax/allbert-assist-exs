# Agent Context Map

This is the optional, lazy-loaded routing map for coding agents. Use it when a
task touches released behavior and the active plan plus ADRs are not enough.
Do not load every section by default.

## How To Use This File

- Start with `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, the roadmap, the active plan, and
  relevant ADRs.
- Read only the subsystem section below that matches the task.
- Use `CHANGELOG.md` for shipped-history context and regression clues.
- Treat active plans, ADRs, code, and tests as more authoritative than
  historical release summaries.
- Do not add AI-tool attribution, co-author trailers, or generated-by footers
  to commits, PR text, release notes, changelog entries, or generated docs.

- v0.25: Native financial specialist agents for StockSage: 9 reusable
  supervised LLM-capable `Jido.Agent` delegate specialists whose execute
  command calls Jido.AI (analysts, bull/bear theses, 3 risk debaters,
  decision synthesizer) + 1 deterministic Jido.Agent quality gate + 1 JidoBacked
  `StockSage.Agents.NativeCoordinator` orchestrator. Multi-round
  bull/bear/risk debate runs inside the plugin-owned coordinator graph
  while recording durable v0.24 objective steps. 5 tiered evidence actions
  (`StockSage.Actions.Evidence.*`) with new `:stocksage_evidence_fetch`
  permission class. `--engine both` parallel parity runs with 5-point
  rating-scale agreement metric. Per-agent model profiles drive Jido.AI
  generation when `stocksage.native_llm_enabled` is true. Prompt files are
  Allbert-authored; verbatim TradingAgents prompt adaptation is deferred
  until an explicit license audit. New `mix allbert.delegate
  <agent_id>` Mix task in Allbert core proves cross-app callability.
  No one-for-one Python graph clone. No automatic native → Python
  fallback, and no persistent Python/parity engine default.
- v0.26: Agentic Workspace Surface And Ephemeral UI Substrate. The
  `/agent` LiveView becomes a fully-dynamic workspace shell rendered
  by walking a Surface tree composed of regions, tiles, and
  ephemeral surfaces. Per-thread Canvas (persistent tiles bound to
  v0.12 thread; survives refresh + restart) and per-thread Ephemeral
  Surfaces (task-scoped overlays, shared across tabs of same thread,
  GC'd on thread close). Hybrid SQLite-metadata + YAML-body
  persistence. Catalog expands from 12 → 38 components (10 workspace
  structural + 12 Allbert-domain + 4 Allbert-app cards + 4 reserved
  StockSage cards rendered as stubs + 12 v0.18 carryover). Strict +
  HMAC-signed `FragmentEnvelope` emission via
  `allbert.workspace.fragment.**` SignalBus topic; receiver
  validates envelope shape, signature, catalog component, emitter
  allow-list, per-emitter rate limit, payload size. Multi-tab sync
  via PubSub. WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (keyboard nav + ARIA + focus
  traps + skip-to-content). Dark mode + theme toggle. Mobile
  responsive (two-pane above 768px, single-pane with tab toggle
  below). Full offline canvas editing via service worker + Yjs
  CRDT with automatic merge on reconnect + conflict banner UX.
  Internal `AllbertAssist.Workspace.AGUI.Bridge` translates curated
  Allbert signals to AG-UI event shape for test-only semantic
  mapping (NOT exposed over HTTP). 14 new `workspace.*` settings.
  New `:workspace_canvas_write` permission class. 9 new
  `allbert.workspace.**` signal topics. `## Workspace` trace
  section + inline `### Workspace` subsection. `mix
  allbert.workspace canvas|ephemeral|inspect|rotate-signing-secret`
  Mix tasks. Per ADR 0023.

## Area Notes

### Runtime And Actions

Runtime-facing, effectful, security-relevant, or observable behavior should
enter through signals, internal agents/runtime routers, and registered Jido
actions. CLI tasks, LiveViews, jobs, and channels should not own domain
semantics directly. Use `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3` for action
execution so lifecycle signals, runner metadata, permission decisions,
redaction, and traces stay consistent.

### Security And Resource Access

Security Central owns permission decisions. Skills, model output, app metadata,
plugin metadata, YAML declarations, and generated files never grant authority.
Resource grants are operation-scoped; a grant for one operation class must not
authorize another.

### Memory

Markdown memory is the long-term, inspectable source of truth. SQLite
conversation history is separate local workspace context and is not
auto-promoted. v0.21 added review, correction, archive, prune, promotion,
derived indexes/summaries, and metadata-only memory intent candidates.

### Plugins And Apps

Plugins are package/discovery contracts, not authority. They may contribute
apps, actions, skills, settings schema entries, channel descriptors, and
supervised children. They must not load arbitrary code from user folders, grant
trust, grant permissions, bypass confirmations, or execute package managers
during discovery.

### StockSage

StockSage is a shipped source-tree plugin app under `./plugins/stocksage`.
It uses `AllbertAssist.Repo` and `stocksage_*` tables. Do not create
`apps/stocksage`, `apps/stocksage_web`, or a separate `StockSage.Repo`.
Permission for local domain writes does not authorize financial API calls or
analysis execution.

v0.25 native financial agents are plugin-owned but runtime-callable through
the shared objective delegate-agent substrate. Read
`docs/plans/v0.25-plan.md`, `docs/plans/v0.25-request-flow.md`, ADR 0020, ADR
0021, and ADR 0022 before touching them. The native agents should adapt the
TradingAgents baseline's role intent, fixtures, and result fields, not clone
every Python role/class one for one. v0.25 prompt/control files are
Allbert-authored; verbatim upstream prompt adaptation requires a future
explicit license-audit milestone.
`plugins/stocksage/priv/python/bridge.py` contains the bridge protocol and
final-state field list, not the role prompts; prompt inventory belongs under
`plugins/stocksage/priv/prompts/native_agents/`.

Native financial agents register 12 stable ids in
`AllbertAssist.Objectives.AgentRegistry` at app boot (per ADR 0022
Amendment A1):

- `stocksage.market_context` — Jido.AI; tool: FetchMarketData
- `stocksage.news_sentiment` — Jido.AI; tools: FetchNews, FetchSentiment
- `stocksage.fundamentals` — Jido.AI; tools: FetchMarketData, FetchFundamentals, FetchFinancials
- `stocksage.bull_thesis` — Jido.AI; multi-round capable
- `stocksage.bear_thesis` — Jido.AI; multi-round capable
- `stocksage.risk_aggressive` — Jido.AI; multi-round capable; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.risk_conservative` — Jido.AI; multi-round capable; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.risk_neutral` — Jido.AI; multi-round capable; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.research_manager` — Jido.AI; preliminary research decision; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.trader_plan` — Jido.AI; bounded advisory plan; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.decision_synthesizer` — Jido.AI; slow-profile default
- `stocksage.quality_gate` — plain Jido.Agent (deterministic; no LLM)

Plus one supervised JidoBacked orchestrator NOT registered in
AgentRegistry: `StockSage.Agents.NativeCoordinator` (per ADR 0022 A3).
The coordinator owns per-analysis projection, multi-round dispatch
order, and parity-run composition; it is called from
`StockSage.Actions.RunAnalysis` via `JidoBacked.dispatch/4`.

All agents return bounded advisory report packets per ADR 0022 only.
Market data, news, fundamentals, persistence, confirmations, settings,
traces, and final analysis writes still flow through registered
actions, `Actions.Runner.run/3`, Security Central, and Resource
Access Security Posture. The 5 tiered evidence actions live under
`StockSage.Actions.Evidence.*` and are gated by the new
`:stocksage_evidence_fetch` permission class (per ADR 0022 A4).

Multi-round debate (bull/bear/risk) is implemented inside the
plugin-owned native coordinator graph. Each specialist turn still
creates one `objective_steps` row of `kind: :delegate_agent` with
round metadata (per ADR 0022 A2). Operators inspect rounds via
`mix allbert.objectives show <id>`.

Engine choice is request-scoped. Absent engine means native;
`--engine python` and `--engine both` are explicit
comparison/reference modes, not Settings Central defaults.
`--engine both` runs native + Python concurrently; persists ONE
analysis row with both engines' fields populated + parity_diff JSON
(per ADR 0022 A5, A6). Parity metric: 5-point rating-scale agreement
(exact 1.0 / adjacent 0.5 / distant 0.0) + bounded confidence delta.

Cross-app callability: `mix allbert.delegate <agent_id>` Mix task lives
in Allbert core (not StockSage) and proves any registered specialist
agent is callable from outside StockSage via the v0.24 DelegateAgent
registered action + AgentRegistry (per ADR 0022 A7).

### Workspace And Surfaces

Apps may have reviewed Phoenix LiveViews and routes, but web surfaces must be
declared through `AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider` and validated by
`AllbertAssist.Surface`. Surface metadata is not authority and must not create
routes dynamically without an explicit plan.

v0.26 expands the Surface DSL substrate from a single chat-only `/agent`
LiveView to the **agentic workspace shell**:

- The workspace shell IS itself a Surface tree (per ADR 0023 §2 + the
  v0.26 design choice). `CoreApp.surfaces/0` declares the workspace
  tree at boot; the renderer walks it and dispatches each node's
  `:component` atom to a LiveComponent module via
  `AllbertAssist.Workspace.Catalog.component_renderer/1`. There is
  NO hardcoded HEEx layout for regions.
- Per-thread Canvas (persistent tiles) lives in SQLite metadata +
  YAML body under `<ALLBERT_HOME>/workspace/canvas/<user_id>/<thread_id>/`.
  Per-thread Ephemeral Surfaces live in SQLite + YAML under
  `<ALLBERT_HOME>/workspace/ephemeral/<user_id>/<thread_id>/`. Both
  shared across browser tabs viewing the same thread via PubSub
  topics `workspace_tiles:<user_id>:<thread_id>` +
  `workspace_ephemerals:<user_id>:<thread_id>`.
- Runtime Fragment emission is signal-topic-driven: any in-BEAM
  module publishes a HMAC-signed `%Workspace.Fragment.Envelope{}` to
  `allbert.workspace.fragment.**`; `AllbertAssistWeb.SignalBridge`
  (extends v0.24) validates strictly (envelope shape + signature +
  catalog component + emitter allow-list + per-emitter rate limit +
  payload size) and forwards valid envelopes to per-user PubSub
  topic `workspace_fragments:<user_id>`. Invalid envelopes drop
  with bounded log + `allbert.workspace.fragment.dropped` signal.
- 38-component catalog (per ADR 0015 v0.26 amendment): 12 v0.18
  carryover + 10 workspace structural + 12 Allbert-domain + 4
  Allbert-app cards + 4 reserved StockSage cards. StockSage card
  rendering ships in v0.27; v0.26 ships stubs.
- 14 new `workspace.*` settings (theme, offline, accessibility,
  mobile breakpoint, fragment rate limits, etc.). New
  `:workspace_canvas_write` permission class.
- Full UX qualities first-class in v0.26: dark mode + WCAG 2.1 AA
  accessibility + mobile responsive + offline editing via Yjs CRDT
  with automatic merge on reconnect + conflict-banner UX.
- Internal `AllbertAssist.Workspace.AGUI.Bridge` translates curated
  Allbert signals to AG-UI event shape for test-only semantic
  mapping; NOT exposed over HTTP. Public AG-UI / A2UI / MCP Apps
  interop is post-v0.31 (per Future Features Post-v0.31 UI Protocol
  Interop).

Sibling routes (`/objectives/:id`, `/jobs`, `/settings`) remain
top-level for deep-linking AND are reachable as tiles inside the
workspace. Plugins do NOT contribute workspace regions in v0.26
(post-v0.31 work); plugins MAY emit Fragments via the SignalBus
topic (existing v0.26 emission path).

### Jido.Agent vs. GenServer Substrate (v0.23)

Allbert uses both `Jido.Agent` and plain `GenServer` for state-bearing
components. The pragmatic rule (from v0.23 and the vision): use `Jido.Agent`
when state machines, documented lifecycle hooks (`on_before_cmd/2`,
`on_after_cmd/3`), Skill composition, or successor agents are plausibly
useful; use plain `GenServer` for stateful storage where Jido.Agent buys
nothing. As of v0.23, `IntentAgent`,
`Confirmations.Store.Agent`, and `Jobs.Scheduler.Agent` are Jido agents;
v0.24 adds `Objectives.Engine.Agent`. `Confirmations.Store` remains Allbert
Home file-backed, not SQLite-backed. `Jobs.Scheduler` remains
SQLite-job-backed and keeps no authoritative in-memory job queue. `Settings`,
`Trace`, `Memory` storage IO, `Session.Scratchpad`, `Memory.Compiler`, and
`Memory.Promotion` stay plain GenServers/modules. New modules document their
substrate choice in the module `@moduledoc`. Private Jido command modules
inside these agents are not registered Allbert capability actions and must not
appear in intent candidates. Worked conversion details live in
`docs/developer/jido-agent-pattern.md`. Transitional compatibility modules
used during v0.23 parity testing were removed before release closeout, while
retained fixture snapshots under `apps/allbert_assist/test/fixtures/v0.23/`
document canonical confirmation audit and scheduler summary behavior.

### Objectives And Advisory Providers (v0.24)

The objective runtime is the durable cross-turn substrate. `Objectives`
hold acceptance criteria and status; `Objectives.Step` records
per-step work; `Objectives.Event` records lifecycle history.
`Objectives.Engine.Agent` is a JidoBacked agent implementing a
seven-stage state machine: receive → interpret intent → frame/resume
objective → propose and evaluate steps → authorize → execute → observe
and advance. The seven-stage pipeline is implemented by 10 real private
`AllbertAssist.Objectives.Commands.*` `Jido.Action` modules routed through
JidoBacked signal dispatch; they are not registered actions and must not appear
as intent candidates. Do not define custom `cmd/3` functions on a JidoBacked
agent; `use Jido.Agent` already provides that API.

Facade rule: use `AllbertAssist.Objectives.list/2`, `get/2`, `frame/2`,
`advance/2`, `cancel/3`, `continue/2`, or registered objective actions for
lifecycle transitions. The lower-level create/update/list helpers in the same
module are internal store helpers. `frame/2` requires explicit user identity.

Authority rule (ADR 0021): `objective_id` is not permission;
`active_app` on an objective is not permission; advisory provider
output (LLM proposers, world-model predictors, diffusion proposers,
market allocators, probabilistic critics) is never authority. Everything
effectful flows through `Actions.Runner.run/3` and Security Central.
Objective-driven `RunAnalysis` or other app actions must still use the
registered action runner path; the objective engine never calls
confirmation storage directly.

Delegate rule: `AllbertAssist.Objectives.AgentRegistry` is a monitored local
registry. It evicts dead registered agent processes and dispatches through
`Jido.AgentServer.call/3`; plugins should not keep their own hidden delegate
agent lookup tables.

Durability rule: JidoBacked state is a rebuildable projection. Hybrid
proposer continuation state is stored in durable
`objectives.proposer_hint` JSON and only cached in
`Engine.Agent.proposer_hints`. Crash/rehydrate behavior should reload
from SQLite, not from serialized agent state.

Signal rule: v0.24 preserves legacy `allbert.input.received` and
`allbert.agent.responded` emissions and adds canonical
`allbert.runtime.turn.started` / `allbert.runtime.turn.completed`
aliases. Objective signals publish through the named
`Jido.Signal.Bus` (`AllbertAssist.SignalBus`); web subscribers use
`allbert.objective.**`, not `allbert.objective.*`. SignalBridge lives
in the web app and broadcasts objective events to per-user PubSub
topics; the engine remains Phoenix-agnostic.

ADR accounting: v0.24 M2 amends ADR 0019 to register the `:objective`
candidate kind. v0.24 M6 moves ADR 0021 to Accepted after confirming
the implemented `:objective_write`, `parent_step_id`,
`objectives.proposer_hint`, minimal `:delegate_agent`, `:abandoned`,
signal, and confirmation-threading contracts.

Reserved vocabulary: capability inventory, capability gap, route,
acquisition option, world-model provider, diffusion proposer, market
allocator. Named in ADR 0021; not implemented in v0.24. Research note
at `docs/research/objective-runtime-research.md`.
