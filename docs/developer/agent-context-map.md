# Agent Context Map

This is the optional, lazy-loaded routing map for coding agents. Use it when a
task touches released behavior and the active plan plus ADRs are not enough.
Do not load every section by default.

## How To Use This File

- Start with `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, the roadmap, the active plan, and
  relevant ADRs.
- Read only the subsystem section below that matches the task.
- Use `CHANGELOG.md` for shipped-history context and regression clues.
- Treat active plans, ADRs, code, and tests as more authoritative than
  historical release summaries.
- Do not add AI-tool attribution, co-author trailers, or generated-by footers
  to commits, PR text, release notes, changelog entries, or generated docs.

## Area Notes

### Runtime And Actions

Runtime-facing, effectful, security-relevant, or observable behavior should
enter through signals, internal agents/runtime routers, and registered Jido
actions. CLI tasks, LiveViews, jobs, and channels should not own domain
semantics directly. Use `AllbertAssist.Actions.Runner.run/3` for action
execution so lifecycle signals, runner metadata, permission decisions,
redaction, and traces stay consistent.

### Security And Resource Access

Security Central owns permission decisions. Skills, model output, app metadata,
plugin metadata, YAML declarations, and generated files never grant authority.
Resource grants are operation-scoped; a grant for one operation class must not
authorize another.

### Memory

Markdown memory is the long-term, inspectable source of truth. SQLite
conversation history is separate local workspace context and is not
auto-promoted. v0.21 added review, correction, archive, prune, promotion,
derived indexes/summaries, and metadata-only memory intent candidates.

### Plugins And Apps

Plugins are package/discovery contracts, not authority. They may contribute
apps, actions, skills, settings schema entries, channel descriptors, and
supervised children. They must not load arbitrary code from user folders, grant
trust, grant permissions, bypass confirmations, or execute package managers
during discovery.

### StockSage

StockSage is a shipped source-tree plugin app under `./plugins/stocksage`.
It uses `AllbertAssist.Repo` and `stocksage_*` tables. Do not create
`apps/stocksage`, `apps/stocksage_web`, or a separate `StockSage.Repo`.
Permission for local domain writes does not authorize financial API calls or
analysis execution.

### Workspace And Surfaces

Apps may have reviewed Phoenix LiveViews and routes, but web surfaces must be
declared through `AllbertAssist.App.SurfaceProvider` and validated by
`AllbertAssist.Surface`. Surface metadata is not authority and must not create
routes dynamically without an explicit plan.

### Jido.Agent vs. GenServer Substrate (v0.23)

Allbert uses both `Jido.Agent` and plain `GenServer` for state-bearing
components. The pragmatic rule (from v0.23 and the vision): use `Jido.Agent`
when state machines, documented lifecycle hooks (`on_before_cmd/2`,
`on_after_cmd/3`), Skill composition, or successor agents are plausibly
useful; use plain `GenServer` for stateful storage where Jido.Agent buys
nothing. As of v0.23, `IntentAgent`,
`Confirmations.Store.Agent`, and `Jobs.Scheduler.Agent` are Jido agents;
v0.24 adds `Objectives.Engine.Agent`. `Confirmations.Store` remains Allbert
Home file-backed, not SQLite-backed. `Jobs.Scheduler` remains
SQLite-job-backed and keeps no authoritative in-memory job queue. `Settings`,
`Trace`, `Memory` storage IO, `Session.Scratchpad`, `Memory.Compiler`, and
`Memory.Promotion` stay plain GenServers/modules. New modules document their
substrate choice in the module `@moduledoc`. Private Jido command modules
inside these agents are not registered Allbert capability actions and must not
appear in intent candidates. Worked conversion details live in
`docs/developer/jido-agent-pattern.md`. Transitional compatibility modules
used during v0.23 parity testing were removed before release closeout, while
retained fixture snapshots under `apps/allbert_assist/test/fixtures/v0.23/`
document canonical confirmation audit and scheduler summary behavior.

### Objectives And Advisory Providers (v0.24)

The objective runtime is the durable cross-turn substrate. `Objectives`
hold acceptance criteria and status; `Objectives.Step` records
per-step work; `Objectives.Event` records lifecycle history.
`Objectives.Engine.Agent` is a JidoBacked agent implementing a
seven-stage state machine: receive → interpret intent → frame/resume
objective → propose and evaluate steps → authorize → execute → observe
and advance. The seven-stage pipeline is implemented by 10 real private
`AllbertAssist.Objectives.Commands.*` `Jido.Action` modules routed through
JidoBacked signal dispatch; they are not registered actions and must not appear
as intent candidates. Do not define custom `cmd/3` functions on a JidoBacked
agent; `use Jido.Agent` already provides that API.

Facade rule: use `AllbertAssist.Objectives.list/2`, `get/2`, `frame/2`,
`advance/2`, `cancel/3`, `continue/2`, or registered objective actions for
lifecycle transitions. The lower-level create/update/list helpers in the same
module are internal store helpers. `frame/2` requires explicit user identity.

Authority rule (ADR 0021): `objective_id` is not permission;
`active_app` on an objective is not permission; advisory provider
output (LLM proposers, world-model predictors, diffusion proposers,
market allocators, probabilistic critics) is never authority. Everything
effectful flows through `Actions.Runner.run/3` and Security Central.
Objective-driven `RunAnalysis` or other app actions must still use the
registered action runner path; the objective engine never calls
confirmation storage directly.

Delegate rule: `AllbertAssist.Objectives.AgentRegistry` is a monitored local
registry. It evicts dead registered agent processes and dispatches through
`Jido.AgentServer.call/3`; plugins should not keep their own hidden delegate
agent lookup tables.

Durability rule: JidoBacked state is a rebuildable projection. Hybrid
proposer continuation state is stored in durable
`objectives.proposer_hint` JSON and only cached in
`Engine.Agent.proposer_hints`. Crash/rehydrate behavior should reload
from SQLite, not from serialized agent state.

Signal rule: v0.24 preserves legacy `allbert.input.received` and
`allbert.agent.responded` emissions and adds canonical
`allbert.runtime.turn.started` / `allbert.runtime.turn.completed`
aliases. Objective signals publish through the named
`Jido.Signal.Bus` (`AllbertAssist.SignalBus`); web subscribers use
`allbert.objective.**`, not `allbert.objective.*`. SignalBridge lives
in the web app and broadcasts objective events to per-user PubSub
topics; the engine remains Phoenix-agnostic.

ADR accounting: v0.24 M2 amends ADR 0019 to register the `:objective`
candidate kind. v0.24 M6 moves ADR 0021 to Accepted after confirming
the implemented `:objective_write`, `parent_step_id`,
`objectives.proposer_hint`, minimal `:delegate_agent`, `:abandoned`,
signal, and confirmation-threading contracts.

Reserved vocabulary: capability inventory, capability gap, route,
acquisition option, world-model provider, diffusion proposer, market
allocator. Named in ADR 0021; not implemented in v0.24. Research note
at `docs/research/objective-runtime-research.md`.
