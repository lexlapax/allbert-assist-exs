# Allbert Future Features Parking Lot

This file tracks features that have been identified in plans, ADRs, or
discussion, but are not yet assigned to a concrete roadmap milestone with an
implementation-ready plan.

Use this as a parking lot, not a backlog commitment. When a feature graduates
into `docs/plans/roadmap.md` with a versioned plan, remove or update its entry
here.

## Already Planned Elsewhere

These are deferred from v0.03 or v0.04 but already have roadmap homes:

- Action-backed Allbert skills: v0.04.
- Confirmation workflow: v0.05.
- Local execution sandbox and shell adapter: v0.06.
- Skill script runner: v0.07.
- External services, package installs, and online skill import: v0.08.
- Execution-aware intent contract: v0.09.
- Scheduled jobs: v0.10.
- Additional channels: v0.11.
- Memory review and retrieval: v0.12.
- Cross-surface intent enrichment: v0.13.

Do not duplicate those here unless the future feature is broader than the
existing plan.

## Unassigned Future Features

### Autonomous Skill Creation

Source: origin note, ADR 0003, v0.03 and v0.04 non-goals.

Allbert should eventually help create new skills from traces, repeated tasks,
corrections, or explicit user requests. v0.04 may add a developer-oriented
skill creation/validation helper, but autonomous creation is larger.

Needed before planning:

- stable skill registry and validator
- skill eval fixtures
- review and trust workflow
- trace-to-skill draft workflow
- explicit operator approval before enabling
- policy for generated code versus instruction-only skill drafts


### Dynamic Elixir Code Generation Or Module Loading

Source: v0.03/v0.04 execution-boundary clarification.

Allbert should not auto-generate, compile, or load Elixir modules from
arbitrary skill folders. A future developer tool may scaffold ordinary Elixir
action code, but runtime module loading from user skills is not planned.

Needed before planning:

- separate ADR for code-generation boundaries
- review/compile/test workflow
- explicit distinction between scaffolding code and enabling capability
- rollback and migration story

### Remote Secrets Manager

Source: v0.02 non-goals.

v0.02 uses an encrypted local Settings Central secret store. A future milestone
may add an adapter for an OS keychain, cloud secret manager, or enterprise
vault.

Needed before planning:

- local secret store stability
- provider abstraction for secret backends
- migration/export policy
- offline behavior
- redaction and audit consistency across backends

### Remote Sync And Profile Export/Import

Source: v0.02 non-goals and ADR 0005 consequences.

Allbert Home gives a clear local boundary for backup and migration, but there
is no remote sync or full profile import/export plan yet.

Needed before planning:

- stable Allbert Home layout
- schema/version metadata for settings, memory, skills, cache, and database
- encrypted secret migration policy
- conflict resolution policy
- operator-visible dry run and rollback

### Multi-User Authorization Model

Source: v0.02, v0.05, and v0.10 non-goals.

Allbert is currently a local single-operator assistant. A multi-user model may
matter for shared workspaces, team channels, or hosted deployments.

Needed before planning:

- identity model
- operator/user roles
- per-user Settings Central scope
- per-user memory and channel policy
- audit and confirmation ownership

### Full Settings UI Polish

Source: v0.02 non-goals.

The v0.02 settings LiveView is functional by design. A future product/UI
milestone may make Settings Central easier to browse, search, validate, and
operate.

Needed before planning:

- stable settings schema
- operator workflows from real usage
- grouping, search, validation, and audit navigation design
- secret entry UX
- accessibility and mobile behavior

### Browser/Search Capture

Source: origin note and v0.11 candidate channels.

The origin note describes capturing searches or browsing activity and turning
useful context into memory. v0.11 gives browser/search capture a possible
channel-adapter home, but deeper extraction and memory promotion behavior may
need a later focused milestone.

Needed before planning:

- channel adapter foundation
- external network/browser permission policy
- memory review workflow
- sensitive-data detection and confirmation
- traceable extraction path

### Small-Model Memory Or Personality Distillation

Source: origin note and roadmap future research.

The origin note imagines compiled memory, nightly distillation, or a small
personal model. This remains research until memory review, trace quality, and
retrieval are stable.

Needed before planning:

- reviewed markdown memory corpus
- rebuildable derived artifacts
- evals for personality and recall quality
- privacy and deletion policy
- training cost and reproducibility policy

### Native UI Surface

Source: origin note and v0.11 candidate channels.

Native UI is listed as a possible channel but has no dedicated plan. It should
not be planned before the channel adapter contract is stable.

Needed before planning:

- channel adapter contract
- Settings Central channel preferences
- authentication or local operator identity policy
- confirmation handoff behavior
- packaging/release approach


### Scripting Engine Interface

Source: origin note and v0.03/v0.04 non-goals.

The origin note leaves room for Lua, Python, JavaScript, or another scripting
interface. Elixir remains the runtime substrate for now; no scripting engine is
currently planned.

Needed before planning:

- clear use cases that are not better served by Jido actions
- sandbox and dependency policy
- permission and confirmation integration
- trace and audit integration
- install/update story for runtime dependencies

## Review Cadence

Review this file when:

- closing a roadmap release
- adding a new roadmap milestone
- converting a non-goal into planned work
- discovering a repeated operator request that does not fit the current
  roadmap
